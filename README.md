### Motivation Behind The Project

The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the development of more dependable and robust antispam filters. Any promotional messages or advertisements that end up in our inbox can be categorised as spam as they don't provide any value and often irritates us.

### Aim of The Project 
The goal here is to make a classifier that lets you find if any text or email you recieve is SPAM or HAM (NOT SPAM)

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according to being ham (legitimate) or spam.

The data was obtained from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning [Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)



### Project Timeline (Steps Performed) :

* Remove the unwanted data columns
* Preprocessing and Exploring the Dataset
* Build word cloud to see which message is spam and which is not.
* Remove the stop words and punctuations
* Convert the text data into vectors


#### Building a sms spam classification model

* Split the data into train and test sets
* Use Sklearn built-in classifiers to build the models
* Train the data on the model
* Make predictions on new data
